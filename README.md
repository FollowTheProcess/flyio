**Solving the [fly.io] [distributed systems challenges] in Go**

## Project Description

This is my take on solutions for the challenges detailed at <https://fly.io/dist-sys>

Although I'm doing it in Go, I've chosen not to use the provided [maelstrom] library to implement the node and messages. There are a few reasons for this:

- Using their library to take care of all the plumbing feels like cheating ðŸ˜‰
- The way the Go implementation has been done means the same message gets `json.Marshal/Unmarshal'd` several times which isn't ideal for performance
- Fun
- I think I can come up with a nicer design pattern to handle messages concurrently (I guess we'll see)
